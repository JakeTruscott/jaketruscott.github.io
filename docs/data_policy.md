# Special Note Re: Data Accessibility from `LexisNexis`

This research draws on legal opinions sourced from the `LexisNexis` database, a proprietary legal research platform. These texts include federal and state court opinions that form the basis for our computational analysis. While we describe the methods and results in detail and provide access to derived data products (e.g., model outputs, metadata, or embeddings), we are unable to share the full-text legal documents themselves due to copyright and licensing restrictions.

`LexisNexis` retains ownership of the source texts, and their use is governed by specific terms of service that prohibit redistribution or public dissemination. Accordingly, researchers wishing to replicate or extend this work will need to obtain access to the relevant legal texts through a `LexisNexis` subscription or another licensed provider.

We emphasize that while the textual data are proprietary, our analytical code and derived materials are fully documented and available to facilitate transparency and reproducibility to the extent permitted by the data license.
