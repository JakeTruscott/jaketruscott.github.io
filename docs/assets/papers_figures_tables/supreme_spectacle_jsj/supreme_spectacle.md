title: 'The Supreme Spectacle: An Analysis of Public Attendance at the Supreme Court'
collection: publications
date: "2022-11-01"
excerpt: While many are aware that the Supreme Court allocates seats for the public
  to view oral arguments, substantive analyses that have measured the motivations
  for attendance are lacking. I analyze who attends oral arguments using a descriptive
  approach with a novel dataset of public attendance at Supreme Court oral arguments
  during the 2019 term. A concurrent assessment of interviews conducted on argument
  days illustrates notable differences among the motivations of prospective attendees.
  I conclude by noting that although the linkage between latent case salience and
  the demand for admission to arguments is not neatly discernable, attendance at the
  Supreme Court offers an interesting divergence from perceptions of attendance in
  a traditional courtroom setting.
