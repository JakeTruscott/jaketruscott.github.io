# Analyzing the Rhetoric of Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings
**Jake S. Truscott** <br>
*Journal of Law and Courts* (2023)

<br>

**Abstract**: Supreme Court confirmation hearings place the often-reclusive institution in the public
spotlight and afford members of the Senate Judiciary Committee the ability to pursue
important personal and party goals. I construct and evaluate a measure of rhetorical
sentiment that considers the positive and negative behaviors of committee members during
Supreme Court confirmation hearings between 1971 and 2020. While some observers have
pointed to the evolving dynamics of confirmation hearings as being the result of key
inflection points, I find that these events alone do not explain rhetorical behaviors. Instead,
my results suggest that rhetorical behaviors have been predominately mediated by structures
of party control and the balance of interbranch political power since at least the 1970s. I
conclude by noting how these behaviors can further deteriorate the publicâ€™s perceptions that
the Court remains insulated from the contentious political environment.
