# The Supreme Spectacle: _An Analysis of Public Attendance at the Supreme Court_
**Jake S. Truscott** <br>
*Justice System Journal* (2022)

<br>

**Abstract**: While many are aware that the Supreme Court allocates seats for the public to view oral arguments, substantive analyses that have measured the
motivations for attendance are lacking. I analyze who attends oral arguments using a descriptive approach with a novel dataset of public attendance at Supreme Court oral arguments during the 2019 term. A concurrent
assessment of interviews conducted on argument days illustrates notable
differences among the motivations of prospective attendees. I conclude by
noting that although the linkage between latent case salience and the
demand for admission to arguments is not neatly discernable, attendance
at the Supreme Court offers an interesting divergence from perceptions of
attendance in a traditional courtroom setting.
