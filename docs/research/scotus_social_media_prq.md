# A Social Media Platform Model of Supreme Court News
**Jake S. Truscott** <br>
*Political Research Quarterly* (2024)

<br>

**Abstract**: An economic model of news contends that the pressures of limited column space and market competition force media
actors to be strategic concerning which notable events receive exhaustive coverage, if any at all. Applying this framework
to the Supreme Court can explain why coverage of the Justices’ decision-making has historically been sensationalized and
reserved for decisions sure to have a pronounced effect on public discourse. However, the emergence of social media as
a practical alternative for mass media dissemination raises notable questions, chief among them being whether the
economic framework fully extends to this newer medium. In this study, I analyze media coverage of the Court’s decisions
using Twitter and observe important distinctions among environments for news dissemination. I argue that the apparent
reduction in the economic costs associated with coverage dissemination and consumption on social media platforms like
Twitter requires viewing Supreme Court news in these environments through an amended theoretical framework.
