# Code Repository

Our Code Repository provides full access to the replication code used in our research, including routines and packages written in both `R` and `Python` programming languages. These scripts are intended to reproduce all key estimates, tables, and figures presented in our publications and working papers. By making this code publicly available, we aim to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in computationally-driven research. Access and use are governed by the terms in the MIT License, which includes guidelines on licensing, attribution, and appropriate use. Please consult the policy before downloading or compiling any code.
